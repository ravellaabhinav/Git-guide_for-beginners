## What is Fork?
A fork is a copy of a repository. 
Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.
Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or 
to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.

## Steps to be followed:
1. Open the ```Repository``` you want to fork
2. In the top-right corner of the page, click ```Fork```
