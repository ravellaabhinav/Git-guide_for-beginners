## What is Clone?
When you create a repository on GitHub, it exists as a remote repository.
You can clone your repository to create a local copy on your computer.
We clone the repo to local machine to make it easier to fix merge conflicts, add or remove files, and push larger commits.

## Steps to be followed:
1. Navigate to the main page of the ```repository```
2. Above the list of files, click :arrow_down: Code.
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", click :clipboard:
4. Open Git Bash in location where you want to save the files.
5. Type ```git clone```, and then paste the URL you copied earlier.

```sh
$ git clone <https_url>
```
6. Press ```Enter``` to create your local clone.
