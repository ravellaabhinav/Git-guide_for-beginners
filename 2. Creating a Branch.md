## Why Branch your project?
Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.
By default your repository has one branch named main. 
We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to main.
Branches are ideal for new features or bug fixes.
When a new branch is started, it’ll be a copy of the main branch until you edit it to make new changes. 
A branch typically goes through many steps and approvals before it is ever merged into the main branch.

## Steps to be followed:
1. Open any ```repository```
2. Click the drop down at the top left that says ```branch: main```
3. Type a branch name, 'xyz' into the ```create/search branch text box```
4. Select ```create branch: xyz``` or Hit enter on your keyboard
