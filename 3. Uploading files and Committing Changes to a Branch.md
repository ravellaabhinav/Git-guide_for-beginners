On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. Each commit has an associated commit message, 
which is a description that gives a history of changes and help project contributors understand how the project has changed over time.

1. Create a new ```Repository``` or Open existing ```Repository```
2. Now from ```Code view``` click the drop down at top right of the file list that says ```Add file```
3. Choose ```Create new file``` from the drop down menu
4. Enter name of the file followed by the content
5. Write a commit message that describes your changes.
6. Choose from committing to ```main``` or ```make branch with pull request```
7. Click on ```commit new file```
