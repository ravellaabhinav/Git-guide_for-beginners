## What is a Repository?
To do anything in GitHub, you’ll need to know how to first create a repository. 
Repository is a directory or storage space where your projects can live. 
It is like a folder on your local machine.

## KeyWords:
```Public Repo``` 
  
  Making a Github repo 'public' will mean that anyone can find it and fork it to get the source files for themselves. 
  You can choose who can commit and others can commit by opening pull request.

```Private Repo``` 

  It's just a place to back-up your private code in a remote repository. Only those who you choose can see or commit.  

```README File```
  
  It is used to give a short discription to your project. It can also be a set of instructions to download and setup your project on a local machine. 
  'MarkDown' is a new language used to write the README files, this is similar to HTML.
  Markdown is really simple to learn and use.

```gitignore```

  It is a plain text file where each line contains a pattern for files/directories to ignore. 
  
  Example: compilation products, temporary files IDEs create, etc.

```License```

  Public repositories on GitHub are often used to share open source software. 
  For your repository to truly be open source, you'll need to license it so that others are free to use, change, and distribute the software.
